def patch_3rd_party_libraries():
    """
    A context manager that patches certain save/show functions of the supported libraries (mostly plotting frameworks).
    When exiting this context the patching will be undone.

    show/display functions become no-ops and functions outputting files are patching the storage location
    to be inside <pharaoh-project>/pharaoh_assets/build. For interactive plots the options that control things like
    js/css resources are patched to use a single copy inside the asset folder to avoid wasting diskspace for each plot.
    For static images

    User perspective:
        The patched functions only change their behavior when the script is called by pharaoh. When the script is called
        standalone then the behavior remains unchanged.

    .. important::

        When using this function, either use it as a context manager or instantiate it, assign it to a variable and
        call ``__enter()__`` on it. If no reference to the context manager is kept, it gets garbage-collected and
        shuts down, which leads to a premature reset of patches.
