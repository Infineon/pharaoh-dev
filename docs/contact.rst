Bug reports
-----------

If you think you found a bug, please provide following information when creating an
`issue on GitHub <https://github.com/Infineon/pharaoh-dev/issues>`_:

    -   Your operating system name and version
    -   Infos about your Pharaoh installation:

        Open a terminal with your Pharaoh env loaded (e.g. in PyCharm) and type
        ``pharaoh info`` or ``python -m pharaoh info``.

        That should return something like ``Pharaoh vX.Y.Z [Python 3.9.13, Windows-10-10.0.19045-SP0]``.
    -   Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting
    -   The complete error message and traceback (not just a screenshot of parts of the error)
    -   Log files
    -   Detailed steps to reproduce the bug
    -   Maybe also a list of packages in your Python env: ``pip freeze > pharaoh_env_packages.txt``
