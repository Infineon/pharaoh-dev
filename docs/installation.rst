Installation via Pip
====================

Create a virtual environment
----------------------------

A virtual environment has its own Python binary (which matches the version of the binary that was
used to create this environment) and can have its own independent set of installed Python packages
in its site directories.

The easiest way to create a virtual environment, is to let the IDE PyCharm (recommended) create one for you.
`Configure a virtual environment <https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/creating-virtual-
environment.html#python_create_virtual_env>`_ shows how to do that.

The other option is to create it via command line like follows and then configure PyCharm to use this as
project interpreter.

.. seealso:: `venv â€” Creation of virtual environments <https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html>`_

#.  Open a shell (e.g. an Inicio shell or PowerShell)
#.  Change into your workspace: :code:`cd C:\\temp`
#.  Create a virtual environment: :code:`C:\\Python311\\python.exe -m venv pharaoh_venv`
#.  Activate it:

    -   Powershell :code:`.\\pharaoh_venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1`
    -   Bash: :code:`source ./pharaoh_venv/Scripts/activate`
    -   Cmd/Bat: :code:`.\\pharaoh_venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat`
#.  You should be getting a prefix to your command line like this: :code:`(pharaoh_venv) PS C:\\temp>`
#.  Ensure you use binary packages where possible by installing `wheel` first :code:`pip install wheel`

You can find more information about `virtual environments here
<https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/>`_.


Install
-------

After the virtual environment has been created, activate it and install ifx-pharaoh via pip::

    pip install pharaoh-report[<extras>]

.. note:: Refer to section :ref:`Extras <section_extras>` to install additional dependencies.

.. note:: For updating Pharaoh to the latest version, append the ``-U`` flag to the pip command

Then you would be able to run::

    pip install pharaoh-report[<extras>]
